## Key Components

This project consists of several key components: Data. Model, Objective Functions and Optimization Algorithms

- **Data**: In image data, each example could represent an individual photograph, with features comprising numerical representations of pixel values. In cases where examples share the same number of numerical features, inputs are referred to as fixed-length vectors, and the constant length of these vectors is termed the dimensionality of the data. While fixed-length vectors are convenient, not all data can be easily represented in this format. Images from the Internet, for instance, may vary in resolution and shape, and text data poses challenges due to its varying length.

The abundance of data simplifies tasks, enabling the training of more powerful models and reducing reliance on preconceived assumptions, however, poor data quality or the inclusion of irrelevant features can lead to subpar performance or unintended consequences, such as perpetuating societal biases in predictive models.

- **Model**: The model component refers to the machine learning or statistical models employed in the project. This could include deep learning models, traditional machine learning algorithms, or custom models developed specifically for the task at hand. Most machine learning involves transforming the data in some sense. Deep learning is differentiated from classical approaches principally by the set of powerful models that it focuses on. These models consist of many successive transformations of the data that are chained together top to bottom, thus the name deep learning.

- **Objective Functions**: Objective functions, also known as loss functions or cost functions, are used to quantify the performance of the model. These functions define what the model aims to optimize during training and evaluation, guiding the learning process towards achieving the desired outcomes.

- **Optimization Algorithms**: Optimization algorithms are algorithms used to minimize the objective functions and update the model parameters during training. These algorithms play a crucial role in training the model efficiently and effectively, ensuring convergence to optimal or near-optimal solutions.

Each of these components plays a vital role in the project's success, contributing to the development, training, and evaluation of machine learning models for various tasks.
